# tcp-server
TCP Server and client coded with Python 3.10.

Edit the settings.json to the address you are going to connect to and you can specify any port number it doesn't have to be like mine

If you are running server.py on this host then run client.py on a different machine like a VM or another device

If you are running the server on windows it will prob ask you if you want the windows defender firewall to allow it so press allow access otherwise you won't be able to run the server and the client won't be able to connect to it
